# Country requirements for phone numbers<a name="phone-country-reqs"></a>

Outside the US, regulations often require a local address and specific identification documents in order to purchase and use a phone number\. The address can be a business or personal address\. The following tables list the countries that require identification\. When you [request international phone numbers](request-intl-numbers.md) or you [port existing phone numbers](porting.md), Amazon Chime support works with you to submit the necessary documents\.

**Note**  
Make sure you provide the identities and addresses of the end\-users who use your phone numbers\.
