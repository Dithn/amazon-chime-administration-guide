# Managing Users<a name="manage-users"></a>

The **Users** page lists all of the users in your account\. You can search for a specific user by searching for their email address, view basic user data, and browse to view more information\. 

Administrators of accounts using **Login with Amazon** \(LWA\) also see options to manage permission tiers and remove users from the account\. These actions are managed through Active Directory for accounts where Active Directory is configured and Okta for accounts where Okta is configured\.
