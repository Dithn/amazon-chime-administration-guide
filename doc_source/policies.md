# Use the Policies Page<a name="policies"></a>

The **Policies** page allows you to choose whether users in your organization are able to grant shared control of their computer while in meetings\. Attendees who request shared control of your userâ€™s computer receive an error message indicating that remote control isn't available\.

You can also enable the Amazon Chime call me feature on the **Policies** page\. This feature provides meeting attendees the option to join meetings by receiving a phone call from Amazon Chime\.
