# Step 3: Add Users to Your Amazon Chime Account<a name="add-users"></a>

After you create an Amazon Chime account, you can add yourself and other users to your Amazon Chime account\. You are not charged for invited users, but start paying after a user accepts an invitation and registers\.

**Note**  
If you plan to upgrade your account to an enterprise account, there is no need to invite users through the administration console\. Instead, you claim your domain\(s\), and any users that register with your claimed domain become part of your account\. For more information about claiming your first domain and becoming an enterprise account, see [Claim a Domain](claim-domain.md)\.

**To add users to your Amazon Chime account**

1. Open the Amazon Chime console at [https://console\.chime\.aws\.amazon\.com/](https://console.chime.aws.amazon.com)\.

1. On the **Accounts** page, select the name of your account\.

1. You \(or your user\) receives an email invitation to join the Amazon Chime team that you created\. The email recipient chooses **Accept** in the email invitation\.

1. After a user chooses **Accept** in the email invitation, they are assigned an Amazon Chime Plus license by default\. To upgrade them to an Amazon Chime license Pro, see [Manage User Access and Licenses](manage-access.md)\.

   + If the user has already signed up for an Amazon Chime, they can use the work email address that they used to sign up for Amazon Chime\.

   + If the user hasn't downloaded the Amazon Chime client app \(this can be done at any time\), they can choose **Download Amazon Chime** to download it and sign in if they have an account\. If they don't have an account, they can register to create one\. For more information, see [Step 2: Create an Amazon Chime Account](create-account.md)\.

1. Repeat steps 1â€“5 for all users that you want to invite, including yourself\.
