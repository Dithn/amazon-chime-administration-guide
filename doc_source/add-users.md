# Step 3: Add Users to Your Amazon Chime Account<a name="add-users"></a>

After you create an Amazon Chime account, you can add yourself and other users to the account\. You are not charged for invited users\. You incur charges after a user accepts an invitation, registers, and hosts a meeting\.

**Note**  
When you add a user to your Amazon Chime account, their 30\-day trial ends\. By default, users have Pro permissions and can host scheduled meetings\. To restrict the ability to host meetings, change the userâ€™s permission to Basic\.  
If you plan to upgrade your account to an enterprise account, there is no need to invite users through the administration console\. Instead, claim your domains\. Any users that register with your claimed domain become part of your account\. For more information about claiming your first domain and becoming an enterprise account, see [Claim a Domain](claim-domain.md)\.

**To add users to your Amazon Chime account**

1. Open the Amazon Chime console at [https://console\.chime\.aws\.amazon\.com/](https://console.chime.aws.amazon.com)\.

1. On the **Accounts** page, for **Account name**, select the name of your account\.

1. On the **Users** page, choose **Invite users**\.

1. Enter the email addresses of the users to invite, including yourself, and choose **Invite users**\. 

The invited users receive email invitations to join the Amazon Chime team that you created\. When invited users accept their email invitations and register their Amazon Chime user accounts, they are assigned Amazon Chime Pro permissions by default\. 
+ If an invited user has already signed up for an Amazon Chime account with their work email address, they are granted the assigned permissions and can continue to use that account\.
+ If an invited user hasn't downloaded the Amazon Chime client app yet, they can do so at any time by choosing **Download Amazon Chime** and signing into their account\. If they don't have an account, they can register to create one\. For more information, see [Step 2: Create an Amazon Chime Account](create-account.md)\.
