# Disabling a SIP rule<a name="disable-sip-rule"></a>

Disable SIP rules when you don't need the connection that the rule provides\. Also, you must disable a SIP rule before you delete that rule or an associated SIP media application\. You can disable any rule created by any administrator\. As a best practice, view the rule's details before you disable it, and check to ensure that disabling the rule won't disrupt a call flow\. For more information, see [Viewing a SIP rule](view-a-rule.md)
