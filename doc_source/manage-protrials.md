# Manage ProTrials<a name="manage-protrials"></a>

Users are eligible for a 30\-day free trial and are given ProTrial status when they first register for Amazon Chime\. This gives them the same access to features within Amazon Chime as Pro users, but with a limited set of dial\-in numbers\. A ProTrial ends when the 30\-day period expires, or if the user’s administrator changes the user’s license type tier from the console\. 

To allow your users to keep their ProTrial status for the full 30 days before deciding whether to assign them Pro, don’t change their license type\. 

If you configured Active Directory for your account, users only have the 30\-day ProTrial period if they are in the Active Directory group that you assigned to Amazon Chime Plus\.
