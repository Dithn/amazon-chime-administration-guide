# Provisioning phone numbers<a name="provision-phone"></a>

Use the Amazon Chime console to provision phone numbers for your Amazon Chime account\. Choose from the following approaches: 
+ Amazon Chime Business Calling – Provision and assign phone numbers to your existing Amazon Chime users\.
+ Amazon Chime Voice Connectors – Integrate with an existing phone system\. For more information, see [Managing Amazon Chime Voice Connectors](voice-connectors.md)\.
+ Amazon Chime SIP media applications – Integrate with Amazon Chime SDK meetings\. For more information, see [Managing SIP media applications and rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/manage-sip-applications.html)\.

When provisioning completes, the phone numbers appear in your **Inventory**, and you can assign them to individual users\. After you create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector, you can assign phone numbers to it as well\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Chime Voice Connector](create-voicecon.md)\.
