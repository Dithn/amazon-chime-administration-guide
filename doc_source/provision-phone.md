# Provisioning phone numbers<a name="provision-phone"></a>

Use the Amazon Chime console to provision phone numbers for your Amazon Chime account\. Choose from the following approaches: 
+ Amazon Chime Business Calling – Provision and assign phone numbers to your existing Amazon Chime users\.
+ Amazon Chime Voice Connectors – Integrate with an existing phone system\. For more information, see [Managing Amazon Chime Voice Connectors](voice-connectors.md)\.

When provisioning completes, the phone numbers appear in your **Inventory**, and you can assign them to individual users\. After you create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector, you can assign phone numbers to it as well\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Chime Voice Connector](create-voicecon.md)\.

   + If you submit a support request from the Amazon Chime console, for **Email**, enter the email address associated with your Amazon Chime administrator account, then choose **Submit request**\.
   + If you create a case in AWS Support Center, for **Contact options**, select a contact method\. Optionally, for **Additional contacts**, enter email addresses of people to be notified of case status updates\.

You receive responses from AWS Support in one of the following ways:
+ If you submitted a support request from the Amazon Chime console, AWS Support sends email messages to the **Operations** contact specified under **Alternate Contacts** in the **Contact Information** for your AWS account\. For more information, see [Editing contact information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment.html#manage-account-payment-edit-contacts) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.
+ If you created a case in AWS Support Center, you receive responses based on your selected contact methods and any email addresses you entered for additional contacts\.

If the quantity of numbers that you requested is available, your order takes about a week to complete\. If not, your order takes longer, or operations may ask you to choose numbers from a different zone, though that's rare\.
