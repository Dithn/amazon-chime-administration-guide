# Provisioning Phone Numbers<a name="provision-phone"></a>

Use the Amazon Chime console to provision phone numbers for your Amazon Chime account\. Choose from the Amazon Chime Business Calling or Amazon Chime Voice Connector options\. Amazon Chime Business Calling lets you provision and assign phone numbers to your existing Amazon Chime users, and Amazon Chime Voice Connectors can be integrated with an existing phone system\. For more information, see [Working with Amazon Chime Voice Connectors](voice-connectors.md)\.
