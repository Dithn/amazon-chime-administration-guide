# Manage User Access and Permissions<a name="manage-access"></a>

Access to features within Amazon Chime is determined by the permissions tier assigned to the user\. The ability to sign into Amazon Chime is managed by suspending or activating users\. 

As an Amazon Chime administrator, you can manage the permissions tiers of users in your account\. However, the ability to suspend a user account is only available to enterprise team administrators\. Administrators of team accounts can remove users from their accounts so that they are no longer paying for the userâ€™s permissions\. However, they can't suspend the user and prevent them from signing in\. 

## Manage Permissions<a name="manage-licenses"></a>

How permissions are managed is determined by whether Active Directory or Okta is configured\. If you have Active Directory or Okta configured for your account, permissions management is handled through group memberships\. If Active Directory or Okta is not configured, permissions are managed through the Amazon Chime console\.

### Enterprise Active Directory or Enterprise OpenID Connect Accounts<a name="manage-AD-licenses"></a>

The permissions tier for users who sign in with their Active Directory or Okta credentials is determined by directory memberships\.
