# Manage User Access and Licenses<a name="manage-access"></a>

Access to features within Amazon Chime is determined by the license type assigned to the user\. The ability to sign into Amazon Chime is managed by suspending or activating users\. As an Amazon Chime administrator, you can manage license types of users in your account, but the ability to suspend a user account is only available to enterprise team administrators\. Administrators of team accounts can remove users from their accounts so they are no longer paying for the userâ€™s license, but they can't suspend the user and prevent them from signing in\. 

## Manage Licenses<a name="manage-licenses"></a>

How license types are managed is determined by whether you have Active Directory configured\. If you have Active Directory configured for your account, license management is handled through group memberships\. If Active Directory is not configured, license types are managed through the Amazon Chime console\.
